# SEQu-HEALTH Pro Webhook Documentation

_Currently in Development_

Whenever an employee completes their Daily Health Declaration and Temperature Check on SEQu-HEALTH Pro, you can be alerted immediately and process the data on your systems using API Webhooks.

## Setup

Your webhook url will be configurable in the SEQu-SUITE Admin Panel.

Kindly make sure your url is a `POST` endpoint.

## Security

To ensure your security, we add a `SEQU-SUITE-Signature` HTTP header to the data that we send to your webhook. This header can be used to verify that the request came from SEQu-SUITE's servers.

### Using the Signature

When we activate your account, we will send you a secret that we use to create the `SEQU-SUITE-Signature`

1. Create your own signature: Run the `body` of the JSON payload we sent you through HMAC with SHA256 hash function, using the secret we sent you during account activation as the signing key.
2. Compare your signature with the `SEQU-SUITE-Signature`. If the values match, then the request is valid as it came from us.
